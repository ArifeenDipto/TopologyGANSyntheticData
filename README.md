# Topological Data Analysis for Synthetic Tabular Data 

This code is for the paper titled "Topology for preserving feature correlation in tabular synthetic data".

From reviewing the literature, we found that the GAN based synthetic tabular data generating models are outperforming other models like Variation Autoencoder. However, we identified that the tabular synthetic data cannot preserve the characteristics of the original data (Feature correlation, Manifold, temporal correlation). In this paper, we analyzed the fact that why GAN (CTGAN) can not preserve feature correlations in synthetic data
